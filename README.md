## Description

This project contains an implementation of a distance measuring application for AVR platform using Atmega32 microcontroller. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and an LCD display to measure and display the distance in centimeters.

## Features

- Real-time distance measurement using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Distance display on an LCD screen.

## Requirements

- AVR development board with Atmega32 microcontroller.
- Ultrasonic sensor.
- LCD display.

## Usage

1. Connect your AVR development board to your computer.
2. Compile the code using your AVR toolchain.
3. Upload the compiled binary to your AVR development board using an AVR programmer.
4. Power on your AVR development board.
5. Monitor the distance readings on the LCD display.
6. The distance will be continuously updated in real-time.
